function [selected_timeseries, selected_names] = Extract_Time_Series_And_Names(varargin)

%%%
%
% Function which extracts the necessary timeseries out of the whole data. Returns those timeseries and their names.
% If a region is defined by multiple atlas-regions, the function aggragates the timeseries into a single one by taking the first principal component of the timeseries.

% INPUT:
%   varargin: a varying amount of inputs, but with a certain structure:
%       varargin{1}: N x M matrix (N = #timeseries; M = #timepoints) containing the timeseries.
%       varargin{2,4,6,8,...}: integer/double or array of integers/doubles indicating the index/indices of the timeseries that needs to be extracted/aggragated
%       varargin{3,5,7,9,...}: string name containing the name of the region 
%           if "": the name should be taken from a table based on the index
%           if not "": this is the name for the aggragated region

% OUTPUT:
%   selected_timeseries:
