% General Script that is used to perform Sensor Level Analyses.
% This is the script in which all variables are defined that will be needed for the further analysis. 
% Only this file should be used for sensor level analysis. All other functions are wrapped in this script.
%
% NOTE: only one analysis can be done at a time. This is done so each analysis has its own unique analysis file for publication on osf.
% NOTE: Step 8 contains an auditory cue to let you know if a participant has finished, you can delete this.

% STEP 1: ADJUST VARIABLES HERE %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% This is the part where you adjust the variables to your specific preferences. 
% Check each variable and check if it is correct or not.

    %%%
    % DATA LOCATION VARIABLES
    %%% 

        % don't put a backslash at the end of the path
        % example: 'F:\Study - EEGSTRESS\Dataset\EEG Source Data (130 Regios)'
        location_data_from = ''; %full path to the directory where the data is located.
        location_data_to = ''; %full path to the directory where the new data needs to be stored. 
        location_data_information = ''; %full path to the directory where the dataset information needs to be stored
        location_data_statistics = ''; %full path to the directory where the statistical .csv file needs to be stored.

    %%%
    % MAP NAME VARIABLES
    %%%
    
        %give the name of the map you want the results to be stored in
        % example: pow_results_map_name = 'POWER - DLPFC - Alpha';
        pow_results_map_name = '';
        fc_results_map_name = '';
        dynfc_resuls_map_name = '';
        dyncausal_results_map_name = '';
        graph_results_map_name = '';
        
    %%%
    % FREQUENCY RANGES
    %%%
    
        % give frequency ranges for the known frequency bands in which you are interested
        % example: delta_frequency_range = [0.5 4];
        
        delta_frequency_range = []; % frequency range for the delta frequency band (Hz)
        theta_frequency_range = []; % frequency range for the theta frequency band (Hz)

    % ELECTRODES
    %%%
    
        % selection of the electrodes for which the analysis should be conducted
        % For more information on which electrodes are available, check the electrode layout file which should be linked below
        % You can write "Check_Electrode_Layout" in the command window to see all electrodes in the current configuration
        % This way of working is not efficient, but is done to make sure that the correct electrodes are selected
        %
        % If the analyses need to be run for specific electrodes, use the following as code:
        %   electrode_amount = 4;
